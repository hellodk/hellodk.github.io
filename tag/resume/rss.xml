<h6>Professional Summary:</h6>

<p>Armed with the drive, motivation and self-determination to succeed, I have continually provided above average results while also learning and developing along the way. I work extremely well independently as well as within a team to deliver measurable results based on the business goals. I am a responsible, self-motivated, smart working, dedicated and always considerate of others.</p>

<p>I come from a Java background where I have been developing several tools and solutions over Java and it’s associated frameworks like Spring/Struts using the Agile methodology.</p>

<p>I have primarily been building tools for SysOps/DevOps which can vary from automating tools to monitoring services, web applications, exposing restful API&#39;s or creating interfaces using CORBA to facilitate communication between systems deployed over diverse platforms and have also extensively worked with messaging queue services like Rabbitmq and Apache Kafka. I was responsible for the setup, clustering and monitoring/maintaining the entire fleet of messaging services(both RabbitMQ and Kafka) which served as a mechanism for intercommunication to over 300 microservices in HA mode without downtime.
Besides I have also been working on Blockchain Technology and have developed a few projects on Blockchain and created own cryptocurrency for testing/learning purpose.</p>

<p>Implemented Disaster Recovery management system over Docker and Kubernetes and also migrated existing pre-prod and staging environments over Docker.
I also have also contributed extensively in making different dashboards as part of key performance indicators for multiple clients and have architectured scalable cloud-based(AWS/Azure) applications with extensive use of load balancing tools like HA Proxy, Nginx.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m working as a Corporate Trainer, where I train people from various organisations across the globe primarily on DevOps tools and techniques.</p>
