<h5>Professional Summary:</h5>

<p>Armed with the drive, motivation and self-determination to succeed, I have continually provided above average results while also learning and developing along the way. I work extremely well independently as well as within a team to deliver measurable results based on the business goals. I am a responsible, self-motivated, smart working, dedicated and always considerate of others.</p>

<p>I come from a Java background where I have been developing several tools and solutions over Java and it’s associated frameworks like Spring/Struts using the Agile methodology.</p>

<p>I have primarily been building tools for SysOps/DevOps which can vary from automating tools to monitoring services, web applications, exposing restful API&#39;s or creating interfaces using CORBA to facilitate communication between systems deployed over diverse platforms and have also extensively worked with messaging queue services like Rabbitmq and Apache Kafka. I was responsible for the setup, clustering and monitoring/maintaining the entire fleet of messaging services(both RabbitMQ and Kafka) which served as a mechanism for intercommunication to over 300 microservices in HA mode without downtime.
Besides I have also been working on Blockchain Technology and have developed a few projects on Blockchain and created own cryptocurrency for testing/learning purpose.</p>

<p>Implemented Disaster Recovery management system over Docker and Kubernetes and also migrated existing pre-prod and staging environments over Docker.
I also have also contributed extensively in making different dashboards as part of key performance indicators for multiple clients and have architectured scalable cloud-based(AWS/Azure) applications with extensive use of load balancing tools like HA Proxy, Nginx.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working as a Corporate Trainer, where I train people from various organisations across the globe primarily on DevOps tools and techniques.</p>

<h6>Projects Summary:</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Disaster Recovery
Creating DR infrastructure, requirement gathering and creation of Kubernetes cluster on bare metal servers and implementing the deployment pipelines - blue-green and canary
Infrastructure &amp; service monitoring, sending alerts over slack and SMS</p></li>
<li><p>Payments Service:
Create payments service for facilitating payments transactions using Java and Spring Boot and implementing analytics with Talend to monitor the payments/orders. Invoved in Sprint Planning, Requirement gathering, Architecture planning, writing unit test-cases, coding configuration of the cluster, managing shards/replicas of the payments database, coordinating UAT and SIT and load tests</p></li>
<li><p>Centralized Log Management:
To monitor logs centrally, we needed a powerful tool. Elasticsearch is what we choose for this project and developed on top of Java using Spring Cloud. Initiated the requirement gathering, created UML diagrams, architecture planning, automated deployment &amp; configuration of the cluster, managing shards and the replicas for elasticsearch cluster, analytics on the data using talend</p></li>
<li><p>PCI Compliance:
Ensured the Payments setup is PCI DSS compliant by creating network segmentations for servers(DMZ environment) and implementing Intrusion Detection Systems(OSSEC/Alienvault) &amp; patching(Spacewalk) the air gapped systems. Responsible for getting the VAPT(Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Penetration Testing)</p></li>
