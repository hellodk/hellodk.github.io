      <title>Fancy Bear DDoS for Ransom</title>
      <link>http://hellodk.in//fancy_bear_ddos</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;
Threat Summary : ERT Threat Alert - Fancy Bear DDoS for Ransom
 
Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) has identified an emerging
ransom denial-of-service (RDoS) campaign from a group identifying itself as Fancy Bear. The group has been distributing extortion emails to payment processing vendors in multiple locations across the globe.
In RDoS attacks, the perpetrators send a letter threatening to attack an organization—rendering its business, operations or capability unavailable—unless a ransom is paid by the deadline. This extortion method has grown in popularity every year since 2010 and typically come in the form of a volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. However, it is increasingly in vogue to find techniques that are more piercing and more efficient without generating large volumes. The most advanced attacks combine both volumetric and non-volumetric cyber-attack techniques.
At the end of April, a group claiming to be Fancy Bear began sending out extortion attempts. The extortionist behind this campaign attempted to intimidate their victims by using the name of APT28 (Fancy Bear) and an infamous cyber-espionage group. APT28 is believed to be a nation state-level attacker that uses zero-day exploits and spear phishing attacks to spread malware.
 
Who are affected?
The group claiming to be Fancy Bear is targeting a limited number of financial services organizations – payment processers under the threat of an attack from the Mirai Botnet. Each letter contains a unique bitcoin address. In the note, Fancy Bear listed the IP address of the victim and targeted them with a sample attack.
 
Threat Summary : World's Biggest Botnet Just Sent 12.5 Million Emails With Scarab Ransomware
 
A massive malicious email campaign that stems from the world's largest spam botnet Necurs is spreading a new strain of ransomware at the rate of over 2 million emails per hour and hitting computers across the globe.
The popular malspam botnet Necrus which has previously found distributing Dridex banking trojan, Trickbot banking trojan, Locky ransomware, and Jaff ransomware, has now started spreading a new version of Scarab ransomware.
According to F-Secure, Necurs botnet is the most prominent deliverer of spam emails with five to six million infected hosts online monthly and is responsible for the biggest single malware spam campaigns.
Scarab ransomware is a relatively new ransomware family that was initially spotted by ID Ransomware creator Michael Gillespie in June this year.
 
According to the security firm Forcepoint, the massive email campaign spreading Scarab ransomware virus started at approximately 07:30 UTC on 23 November (Thursday) and sent about 12.5 million emails in just six hours.
The Forcepoint researchers said &quot;the majority of the traffic is being sent to the .com top-level domain (TLD). However, this was followed by region-specific TLDs for the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Germany.&quot;
The spam email contains a malicious VBScript downloader compressed with 7zip that pulls down the final payload, with one of these subject lines:
Scanned from Lexmark
Scanned from Epson
Scanned from HP
Scanned from Canon
As with previous Necurs botnet campaigns, the VBScript contained a number of references to the widely watched series Game of Thrones, like the strings 'Samwell' and 'JohnSnow.'
The final payload is the latest version of Scarab ransomware with no change in filenames, but it appends a new file extension with &quot;.[suupport@protonmail.com].scarab&quot; to the encrypted files.
Once done with the encryption, the ransomware then drops a ransom note with the filename &quot;IF YOU WANT TO GET ALL YOUR FILES BACK, PLEASE READ THIS.TXT&quot; within each affected directory.
The ransom note does not specify the amount being demanded by the criminals; instead, it merely states that &quot;the price depends on how fast you [the victim] write to us.&quot;
However, Scarab ransomware offers to decrypt three files for free to prove the decryption will work: &quot;Before paying you can send us up to 3 files for free decryption.&quot;
 
How to Protect Yourself:
Keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC in order to always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents.
Always be suspicious of any uninvited document sent over an email and should never click on links provided in those documents unless verifying the source.

      <title>Bad Rabbit - New Ransomware Attack</title>
      <link>http://hellodk.in//bad_rabbit_attack</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;
Threat Summary : Bad Rabbit: New Ransomware Attack Rapidly Spreading
 
A new widespread ransomware attack is spreading like wildfire around Europe and has already affected over 200 major organisations, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Germany, in the past few hours.
Dubbed &quot;Bad Rabbit,&quot; is reportedly a new Petya-like targeted ransomware attack against corporate networks, demanding 0.05 bitcoin (~ $285) as ransom from victims to unlock their systems.
According to an initial analysis provided by the Kaspersky, the ransomware was distributed via drive-by download attacks, using fake Adobe Flash players installer to lure victims' in to install malware unwittingly.
&quot;No exploits were used, so the victim would have to manually execute the malware dropper, which pretends to be an Adobe Flash installer. We’ve detected a number of compromised websites, all of which were news or media websites.&quot; Kaspersky Lab said.
However, security researchers at ESET have detected Bad Rabbit malware as 'Win32/Diskcoder.D' — a new variant of Petya ransomware, also known as Petrwrap, NotPetya, exPetr and GoldenEye.
Bad Rabbit ransomware uses DiskCryptor, an open source full drive encryption software, to encrypt files on infected computers with RSA 2048 keys. Bad Rabbit does not use EternalBlue but does leverage EternalRomance RCE exploit to spread across victims' networks.
Microsoft and F-Secure have also confirmed the presence of the exploit in the Bad Rabbit ransomware. EternalRomance is a remote code execution exploit that takes advantage of a flaw (CVE-2017-0145) in Microsoft's Windows Server Message Block (SMB), a protocol for transferring data between connected Windows computers, to bypass security over file-sharing connections, thereby enabling remote code execution on Windows clients and servers.
 
Impact:
Bad Rabbit
 first scans the internal network for open SMB shares, tries a hardcoded list of commonly used credentials
 to drop malware, and also uses Mimikatz
 post-exploitation tool to extract credentials from the affected systems. Bad Rabbit can also exploit the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) scripting interface in an attempt to execute code on other Windows systems on the network remotely, noted
 EndGame. However, according to Cisco's Talos, Bad Rabbit also carries a code that uses EternalRomance, which allows remote hackers to propagate from an infected computer to other targets more efficiently.
 
How to Protect Yourself:
In order to protect yourself from Bad Rabbit, users are advised to disable WMI service to prevent the malware from spreading over your network.
Update your systems regularly and keep a good and effective anti-virus security suite on your system.
Since most ransomware spread through phishing emails, malicious adverts on websites, and third-party apps and programs, you should always exercise caution before falling for any of these.
Most importantly, to always have a tight grip on your valuable data, keep a good backup routine in place that makes and saves copies of your files to an external storage device that isn't always connected to your PC.

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;To make a search of some package or term in the data base in some of the formed deposits yum in the system:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier new,courier;&quot;&gt;yum search any-package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Example: &lt;code&gt;yum search httpd&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;To consult the information contained in a package in individual:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;yum info any-package
&lt;/br&gt;Example: yum info httpd
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Uninstalling packages. Desinstalación of packages along with everything what it depends on these:
&lt;/br&gt;yum remove any-package
&lt;/br&gt;Example: yum remove gkrellm
&lt;/br&gt;The following thing will list all the packages available in the data base yum and that can settle:
&lt;/br&gt;available yum list|less
&lt;/br&gt;The following thing will list all the packages installed in the system:
&lt;/br&gt;yum list installed|less
&lt;/br&gt;The following thing will list all the packages installed in the system and that can (they must) be updated:
&lt;/br&gt;yum list updates|less
&lt;/br&gt;Cleaning of the system.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier new,courier;&quot;&gt;Yum leaves as result of its use heads and packages RPM stored in the interior of the directory located in the route /var/cache/yum/. Particularly the packages RPM that have settled can occupy much space and is by such reason agrees to eliminate them once no longer they have utility. Also it agrees to do the same with the old heads of packages that no longer are in the data base. In order to make the &lt;/br&gt;corresponding cleaning, the following thing can be executed:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;s
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum clean all&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Group install:
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum groupinstall &quot;groupname&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

      <title>RabbitMQ - Detecting Dead TCP Connections with Heartbeats</title>
      <link>http://hellodk.in//detecting-dead-tcp-connections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In some types of network failure, packet loss can mean that disrupted TCP connections take a moderately long time (about 11 minutes with default configuration on Linux, for example) to be detected by the operating system. AMQP 0-9-1 offers a heartbeat feature to ensure that the application layer promptly finds out about disrupted connections (and also completely unresponsive peers). Heartbeats also defend against certain network equipment which may terminate &quot;idle&quot; TCP connections. See Heartbeats for details.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTTP Quick Reference - A Quick reminder about HTTP</title>
      <link>http://hellodk.in//http_quick_reference</link>
      <description>In this tutorial we will cover the basics of an HTTP request and see how it works.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP Transaction Model:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTTP protocol is transaction-driven. This means that each request will lead
to one and only one response. Traditionally, a TCP connection is established
from the client to the server, a request is sent by the client on the
connection, the server responds and the connection is closed. A new request
will involve a new connection :&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://hellodk.in//rethinkdb_installation_ubuntu14</link>
      <description>Let's get some hands on rethinkdb today and find it out yourself. &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
So what is rethinkdb?
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Rethinkdb is an open-source, scalable JSON database built from the ground up for the realtime web.
&lt;/br&gt;RethinkDB inverts the traditional database architecture by exposing an exciting new access model – instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell RethinkDB to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB’s realtime push architecture dramatically reduces the time and effort necessary to build scalable realtime apps. RethinkDB also offers a flexible query language, intuitive operations and monitoring APIs, and is easy to setup and learn. Just like any other database solution, rethinkdb ships as a client-server component model. The installation process for both the server and the client are illustrated below:

      <title>MySQL multi master replication fundas</title>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Master-master replication (more generally -- multi-master replication) conceptually works by assuming that conflicts are not common and only keeping the entire system loosely consistent, asynchonously communication updates between masters, which ends up violating basic ACID properties.

      <description>Too often we under-estimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
The idea behind writing this blog/website is to conect to people and share my experiences with them.

      <title>Going Agntless with Ansible</title>
      <link>http://hellodk.in//going_agentless_with_ansible</link>
      <description>While looking for a light yet powerful Configuration Management tool, I was going through some of the various available tools, and came across Ansible. After having a quick look at the features, something which caught my attention: &quot;Ansible is agent-less&quot;, hence I decided to give it a try. Having used Ansible for some around more than 8+ months configuration management, I personally feel...Ansible is awesome!!
So what is Ansible? Well, it is a configuration management tool, and it empowers you to configure/orchestrate multiple systems at great ease, saving a lot of downtime and resources.
So how does it does that? The answer lies with ssh keys based agent forwarding. Ansible uses ssh for logging to the remote system, and can execute package installation, shell commands, install/update package management systems, clone git and anything under the sun you need for configuration management.
So why don't you try your hands on Ansible and experience it's awesomeness....all you need to do is to install it on your host system.
